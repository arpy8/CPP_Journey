## About
This repository was created to track and showcase my journey in learning and mastering the C++ programming language. Through this documentation, I aimed to provide detailed explanations, code examples, and practical projects to demonstrate my progress in C++.

C++ is a powerful and versatile language widely used in various domains, including systems programming, game development, and high-performance applications. By sharing my journey, I hoped to inspire and assist others who were also interested in learning C++.

## [Code Snippets](Code)
The code directory contains a collection of code snippets covering various C++ concepts, techniques, and idioms. These snippets provide concise examples that focus on specific aspects of the language. They are organized into different folders based on the topics they cover.

They are designed to provide a hands-on understanding of different C++ features, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like templates and object-oriented programming.

## [Project](Project)
In the project directory, you will find practical projects that I completed during my C++ journey. These projects were designed to exercise and apply different aspects of the language, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## [Personal Notes](Personal%20Notes)
Throughout my C++ journey, I maintained a collection of personal notes to record important concepts, insights, and tips that I learned. These notes served as a reference for me and provided a comprehensive overview of my progress.

You can find my personal notes in the notes directory. Feel free to explore my notes and use them as a supplemental resource to enhance your own understanding of C++.
